# 2D Platformer Game

This is a personal project targetted for mobile devices that is still on-going and will be updated. 

About: 

An endless simple 2D platformer game where the player would either click or slide their finger on their device screen to make a jump to the next platform. With each platform they successfully
land on, a point is added to their score. Platforms move left to right at varying speeds as well as changing in size and later.

Controls:

The controls are still not fully decided on or implemented. Currently the player clicks, and the block will move over to the next platform if it's within a certain range.

Future Development:

- Additonal features are going to be added to offer more challenge to the player. 
- Shaders are being considered to create a specific artistic style. 
- Rewards system for the player to purchase cosmetics.
